## Rules for Contributing

1. We use the [angular style](https://kapeli.com/cheat_sheets/Conventional_Commits.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/index) of conventional commits.
2. Test your code before pushing/making a PR! I cannot stress this enough.
3. When linking PRs/Issues please use the shorthand `#123` and not full URLs.
4. Format your changes! Please see `lint.sh` for linting
